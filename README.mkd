Disqussion currently covers *only* stable Disqus API features for: applications, categories, exports, forums, imports, posts, reactions, reports, threads and users.

Missing following features: blacklists and whitelists.

The error classes are consistent with [Disqus documented response codes](http://disqus.com/api/docs/errors/).
Error details from Disqus API are encapsulated in HTTP response.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Response Code</th>
      <th>Error</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>400</tt></td>
      <td><tt>Disqussion::BadRequest</tt></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>401</tt></td>
      <td><tt>Disqussion::Unauthorized</tt></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>403</tt></td>
      <td><tt>Disqussion::Forbidden</tt></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>404</tt></td>
      <td><tt>Disqussion::NotFound</tt></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><tt>500</tt></td>
      <td><tt>Disqussion::InternalServerError</tt></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Here are a few reasons use (and improve) this gem:

* Full Ruby 1.9 compatibility: All code and specs now work in the latest version of Ruby
* Support for HTTP proxies
* Support for multiple HTTP adapters: NetHttp (default), em-net-http (async), Typhoeus, Patron, or ActionDispatch
* SSL: On by default for increased [speed](http://gist.github.com/652330) and security

Help! I'm getting: "Did not recognize your engine specification. Please specify either a symbol or a class. (RuntimeError)"

If you're using the JSON request format (i.e., the default), you'll need to
explicitly require a JSON library. We recommend [yajl-ruby](http://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby).

Usage Examples
--------------
``` ruby
require "rubygems"
require "disqussion"

# Certain methods require authentication. To get your Disqus credentials,
# register an app at http://disqus.com/api/applications/
Disqussion.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = YOUR_API_KEY
  config.api_secret = YOUR_API_SECRET
end

# Get an application's usage details
puts Disqussion::Client.applications.listUsage("the88")
